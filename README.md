Different versions of Minecraft have vastly different architecture, so different versions of LibRikka might not be compatible!

Note:
1. The file `src/fakemod/classes/rikka/librikka/LibRikka.javac` is just the renamed of `src/fakemod/java/rikka/librikka/LibRikka.java`,
It doesnot need reobf or deobf as it does not use any vanilla classes. 
`LibRikka.javac` will be included in the reobf or deobf builds as `LibRikka.class`. 
__Except in development environment, Librikka is a mod.__

Sorry I don't have time to write detailed documentation/tutorials. QAQ! 
But the code itself should be self-explainable.
